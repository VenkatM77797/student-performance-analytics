# Student Performance Data Validation and Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data using Python and pandas.  
It validates assessment scores to ensure data quality and generates basic insights such as subject-wise average scores and pass/fail counts.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- CSV data files
- VS Code

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (`StudentsPerformance.csv`) contains student assessment details including:
- Math score
- Reading score
- Writing score
- Demographic/background information (gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch, test preparation)

## ✅ Project Features

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Loaded student performance data from a CSV file using pandas.

### 2️⃣ Data Validation
- Checked for invalid scores (less than 0 or greater than 100) across math, reading, and writing columns.
- Ensured all assessment scores fall within acceptable ranges before analysis.

### 3️⃣ Data Analysis
- Calculated average Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
- Counted the number of students who passed and failed Math using a pass mark threshold.

## 📊 Sample Output
The script prints:
- Invalid rows count (if any invalid scores exist)
- Average Math, Reading, and Writing scores
- Students passed math / failed math counts
